Baseline

    For stage 2 we utilized the C45 implementation in Stage 1, our best classifier, as our basline for Stage 2.

Evaluation Metrics

    To compare the performance of our classifiers we examined the accuracy, precison, recall, f1-measure, geometric mean, and kappa statistic

        OOB Error Rate: 24%


Explanation of Tables

    The Random Forest result also includes the OOB Error Rate in leiu of performing 10-fold cross-validation, as this was considered uncessary after performing a literature review of Random Forest
