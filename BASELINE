Baseline

    We used the most likely tag as our baseline. This method selects the entity tag by
    looping over the possible tags and selecting the one with the highest probability given the
    joint probability of the speaker and word.

Evaluation Metrics

    To compare metrics we are just using straight accuracy. In step 2 we will used more advanced metrics.

Explanation of Tables

    For the baseline we just computed the pure accuracy. For the machine learning, we computed the accuracy along with a
    we a few more statistics which will be utilized in stage 2.
