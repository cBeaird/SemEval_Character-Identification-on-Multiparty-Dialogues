# SemEval2018: Task 4 Character Identification on Multiparty Dialogues

## Introduction
Character identification is the task of linking mentions within a dialog to the characters that they reference.  Mentions are in the form of words referencing a person (eg. _he_, _Dad_, _Joey_) which then must be linked to an "entity" or character within the dialog.  What can make this task challenging is that the entity which a mention references may not be a direct participant of the dialog, meaning that information regarding references must be stored and cataloged across multiple dialogs. This task has several applications as part of a larger NLP pipeline such as building a question answering system or text summarization. The SemEval 2018 Task 4: Character Identification on Multiparty Dialogues focuses on this task and is the objective of our work. The task is presented as identifying mentions of characters within the scripts of the first two seasons of the popular television show "Friends".  The scripts have been provided pre-annotated in Conll format as part of the materials for the task.  The objective then, is to devise a system that can correctly identify mentions of not only the main characters of the show, but any and all characters which make appearances.  For example, given the piece of dialog "See! He's her lobster!", the goal is to correctly match the two references "he" and "she" to the corresponding characters that they refer to, in this case Ross Geller and Rachel.  When evaluating the system, special emphasis is place on accuracy and F-1 measures on the main characters as the system will be examined across all entities, as well as across the main characters specifically.  

Our motivation behind our approach to this task was to first begin with a simple probabilistic model which would select the most likely entity a mention refers to based solely on the character speaking the line of dialog and the mention word they used.  We then use this model as a baseline with which we compare against more sophisticated machine learning approaches, where much of the focus of contemporary research lies. Finally, based on our preliminary results, we propose utilizing neural networks as a possible method to achieve higher performance than previously attempted approaches.


## Getting Started
The general idea behind this task is to identify the entity being referred to by a speaker. For example we'll take the sentence "See! He's her lobster!" we have here two references that need to be resolved {he's, her} in this case if we look at the final slide on presentation we have the visual context clues for resolving these mentions. In this case He's is referring to Ross Geller and her to Rachel.

This data for the SemEval task is provided in the Conll format which is tab or space delimited data. The column order for the data is specified to the parser. 

an example of our data is: 

\#begin document (/friends-s01e01) <br />
/friends-s01e01 0 0 There EX (TOP(S(NP*) there - - Monica_Geller * - <br />
/friends-s01e01 0 1 's VBZ (VP* be - - Monica_Geller * - <br />

/friends-s01e01 0 5 ! . *)) ! - - Monica_Geller * - <br /> <br />

/friends-s01e01 0 0 He PRP (TOP(S(NP*) he - - Monica_Geller * (284) <br />
/friends-s01e01 0 1 's VBZ (VP* be - - Monica_Geller * - <br />

/friends-s01e01 0 6 work VBP (VP* work - - Monica_Geller * - <br />
/friends-s01e01 0 7 with IN (PP*)))))) with - - Monica_Geller * - <br />
/friends-s01e01 0 8 ! . *)) ! - - Monica_Geller * - <br />

## Methods
We started by establishing a simple baseline by choosing a speakers most likely tag given a word. From the papers we read, this method seemed to be widely regarded as the method of choice, so we thought it would make a nice baseline for our machine learning algorithms.

We used information from the mentions to create custom feature vectors incorporating both lexical and orthographic properties. We tested a variety of machine learning algorithms in WEKA including Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and C.45.
